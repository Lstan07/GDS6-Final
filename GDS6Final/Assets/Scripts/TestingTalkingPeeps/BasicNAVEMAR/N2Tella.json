So what’s that inside those little bottles?","\n","^TELLA: These bottles are full of water that us Awafe have crafted from around the land!!","\n","^COSMO: Wow, a stall selling plain boring water? Talk about basic and uninteresting…","\n","^CIELLE: Cosmo-!!","\n","^TELLA: Heh.

Our hydrologist Erundir studies everything about these waters, and we sell them here in hopes that they help others as much as they help us!","\n","^COSMO: Okay I take it back this water is so cool! How do you guys even infuse them with all their different things?","\n","^TELLA: You guys should visit the Great Awafe Cove Temple across the market, you’ll be able to find the answers to your questions there from our Leader!","\n","^CIELLE: Oh!
